# Data pipeline

## ETL : Extract Transform Load
### Extract
- Raw data is captured from multiple formats
- since data source is not uniform, hence we need to ingest the data

### Transform
- manipulation of the data. clean, change, aggregate... eg: csv to mongodb format
- online survey form. multiple people filled the form. there's data that is missing
    - 2 way of handling: Delete the data or clean it.

### Load
- Generate Reports
