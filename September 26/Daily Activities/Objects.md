## Why Object Oriented Programming?
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) forms the foundation of many software applications.
- It allows real-world entities (like people, cars, accounts) to be represented as objects in code.
- Real-life objects have attributes (data) and behaviors (functions), which OOP can model effectively.
- OOP makes programs more modular, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.
- It aligns with how humans naturally think about and organize complex systems.

#### There are 3 Types software development methodologies:

DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
Focuses on modeling software based on real-world business domains and logic.

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
Defines application behavior through examples in plain language to improve collaboration.

TDD (Test-Driven Development)
Involves writing tests before code to ensure correctness and guide design.
