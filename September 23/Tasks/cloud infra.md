# Document Analysis: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS

### Introduction
Cloud computing offers various service models that help businesses and developers manage infrastructure, platforms, and software in scalable, efficient ways. 


The three primary cloud service models are:
<b>
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- SaaS (Software as a Service)
  </b>

## 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users rent virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources, typically on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine

### Use Cases
- Startups needing scalable infrastructure without upfront hardware investment
- Enterprises migrating legacy applications to the cloud
- Test and development environments

## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with underlying infrastructure. It abstracts hardware and OS management, offering development tools, databases, middleware, and runtime environments.

Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services, Heroku
### Use Cases
- Developers focusing on application coding without managing servers
- Rapid development and deployment cycles
- Collaborative development environments

## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
Definition
SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access the software via web browsers without managing infrastructure or platform layers.
Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce
### Use Cases
- Businesses needing out-of-the-box solutions for CRM, email, collaboration
- Users requiring accessibility from multiple devices
- Organizations minimizing IT overhead
